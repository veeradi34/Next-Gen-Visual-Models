# Next-Gen-Visual-Models
![Project-Thumbnail](https://github.com/shoryasethia/Next-Gen-Visual-Models/blob/main/WiDS-Thumbnail.png)
Project explores the evolution of image generation, from autoencoders, GANs to SD &amp; the new VAR (Visual Autoregressive Representation) method. VAR enhances image quality and scalability beyond diffusion models. We’ll analyze each stage, explore unique emerging techniques, and work toward developing a novel approach in the near future.
